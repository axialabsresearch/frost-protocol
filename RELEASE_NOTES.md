- Extensible proof verification framework
- P2P networking with libp2p
- Plugin-based extension system
- Efficient message routing

### State Management
- Generic state transition handling
- Proof generation and verification
- Efficient caching mechanisms
- State synchronization primitives

### Networking
- Multiple transport protocol support
- NAT traversal capabilities
- Secure communication channels
- Peer discovery and management
- Connection pooling

### Reliability
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Backpressure handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Error management
- Resource optimization

### Monitoring
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Prometheus metrics export
- Health check system
- Performance tracking

## Getting Started

1. Add to your project:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   frost-protocol = "0.1.0"
   ```

2. Basic usage:
   ```rust
   use frost_protocol::{
       network::BasicNetwork,
       state::StateTransition,
       extensions::ExtensionManager
   };
   ```
